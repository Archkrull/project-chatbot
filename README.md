# Project Name

We have made a chatbot with the theme of a fantasy tour.
The assignment was to make a chatbot with JavaScript.

## The problem

First we made a plan in Jamboard so we knew exactly what theme and which questions we wanted.
We used pair programming and used the example bot a lot for reference. If we got stuck, we either checked stack overflow to post questions or check for other peoples posts, or we tried to google.

If we had more time and more knowledge we would add better effects. For example, changing the bot image depending on which tour guide the user chooses.
